# Overview

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

This api uses node 8.x LTS and express as the server.

## Running the server

To run the server, run:

```shell
npm start
```

### To view the Swagger UI interface

```shell
open http://localhost:8080/api/docs/user
```

### To execute the unit tests

```shell
npm run test
```

There will be a junit formatted report file called userprofile-report.xml under the current userprofile directory `/reports` subfolder.
